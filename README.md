## Description

I built this simple yet modern calculator as part of an assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
Itâ€™s made entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I used it as a way to practice working with Flexbox. The result is a clean, user-friendly interface that handles basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Dynamically updates and formats the calculator display for readability.
- Responsive layout with automatic font-size adjustment for lengthy calculations.
- Keyboard and mouse input support for intuitive usability.
- Built-in input validation to handle incorrect or excessive inputs gracefully.
- Includes 3 color theme options for a customizable look.
